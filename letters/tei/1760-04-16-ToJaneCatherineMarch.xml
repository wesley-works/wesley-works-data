         <p><placeName>Eltham</placeName> is a barren soil indeed. I fear scarce any are to be found
            there who know anything of the power of religion, and not many
            that have so much as the form. But God is there, and he can supply
            every want. Nothing contributes to seriousness more than humility,
            because it is a preparation for every fruit of the Holy Spirit; and the
            knowledge of our desperate state by sin has a particular tendency</pb n="191">
            to keep us earnest after deliverance; and that earnestness can hardly
            consist with levity, either of temper or behaviour.</p>
         <p>Those who have tasted of the goodness of God are frequently
            wanting in declaring it. They do not, as they ought, stir up the gift
            of God which is in every believer by exciting one another to continual
            thankfulness and provoking each other to love and good works.
            We should never be content to make a drawn battle, to part neither
            better nor worse than we met. Christian conversation is too precious
            a talent to be thus squandered away.</p>
         <p>It does not require a large share of natural wisdom to see God
            in all things, in all his works of creation as well as of providence.
            This is rather a branch of spiritual wisdom, and is given to believers
            more and more as they advance in purity of heart.</p>
         <p>Probably it would be of use to you to be as regular as you can;
            I mean, to allot such hours to such employments. Only not to be
            troubled when providence calls you from them. For the best rule of
            all is <hi rend="italic">to follow the will of God</hi>.</p>
