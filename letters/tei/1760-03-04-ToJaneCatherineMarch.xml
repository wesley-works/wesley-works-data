            <p>Certainly the more freedom you use, the more advantage you will
                find. But at the same time <index indexname="biblical"><term cRef="Jas1:17">it

                If he blesses our intercourse with each other, then we shall never 
                repent of the labour.</p>
            <p>It is a blessing indeed when God uncovers our hearts and clearly
                shows us what spirit we are of. But there is no manner of necessity
                that this self-knowledge should make us <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi>. Certainly the
                highest degree of it is well consistent both with peace and joy in the
                Holy Ghost. Therefore how deeply soever you may be convinced of
                pride, self-will, peevishness, or any other inbred sin, see that you
                do not let go that confidence whereby you may still rejoice in God
                your Saviour. Some, indeed, have been quite unhappy though they
                retained their faith, through desire on the one hand and conviction
                on the other. But that is nothing to you; you need never give up
                anything which you have already received. You will not, if you keep
                close to that:
                <lg>
                    <l>For this my <hi rend="italic">vehement</hi> soul <hi rend="italic">stands still</hi>;</l>
                    <l>Restless, <hi rend="italic">resigned</hi>, for this I wait.

                We have a fuller, clearer knowledge of our own members than of
                those belonging to other societies, and may therefore, without any
                culpable partiality, have a better opinion of them.
            </p>
            <p>It is a great thing to spend all our time to the glory of God. But
                you need not be scrupulous as to the precise time of reading and
                praying; I mean, as to the dividing it between one and the other. A
                few minutes one way or the other are of no great importance.
