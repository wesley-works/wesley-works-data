            <salute>Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>On <date when="1759-12-16">Sunday, December 16</date> last, I received a £20 bank bill from an
            anonymous correspondent, who desired me to lay it out in the manner I judged best for the use 
            of poor prisoners.<note place="foot" n="8">Probably due to publicity about <persName>
            <ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s help offered the French prisoners 
            held in <placeName>Knowle prison</placeName> in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, 
            described in earlier letters of <date when="1759-10-20">Oct. 20</date> and 
            <date when="1759-11-04">Nov. 4, 1759</date>.</note> 
            <!--Is there a way to reference other letters? Only the dates of the referenced letters (1759-10-10 and 1759-11-04) were tagged-->
            I immediately employed some in whom I could confide to inquire into the circumstances of
            those confined in <placeName>WhiteChapel</placeName> and <placeName>New Prison</placeName>.
            <note place="foot" n="9"><placeName>Whitechapel</placeName> was a debtor&apos;s prison serving 
            <placeName>Stepney</placeName> and <placeName>Hackney</placeName>; <placeName>New Prison</placeName> 
            was located in <placeName>Clerkenwell</placeName> and held persons accused of petty or serious crimes.</note> 
            I knew the former to have very little allowance even of bread, and the latter none at all.
            Upon inquiry they found one poor woman in <placeName>Whitechapel Prison</placeName>
            very big with child and destitute of all things. At the same time I casually heard of a poor 
            man who had been confined for nine months in the <placeName>Poultry Counter</placeName>,<note place="foot" n="10">
            More commonly known as &apos;<placeName>Poultry Compter</placeName>&apos;, this was a sheriff ’s prison in 
            <placeName>London</placeName> City.</note> while his wife and three children (whom he before maintained by his labour) 
            were almost perishing through want. Not long after, another poor woman, who had been diligent in helping others, was 
            herself thrown into <placeName>Whitechapel Prison</placeName>. The expense of discharging these three and giving them 
            a few necessaries amounted to £10 10s. One pound fourteen shillings I expended in stockings and other clothing, which 
            was given to those prisoners who were in the most pressing want. The remainder, seven pounds
            sixteen shillings, was laid out in bread, which was warily distributed
            thrice a week. I am therefore assured that the whole of this sum was
            laid out in real charity. And how much more noble a satisfaction must
            result from this to the generous benefactor (<index indexName="biblical"><term cRef="Eccl3:19">even supposing there
               were no other world, supposing man to die as a beast dieth</term></index><note place="foot" n="11">
            See <index indexName="biblical"><term cRef="Eccl3:19">Eccles. 3:19</term></index>.</note>) 
            than he could receive from an embroidered suit of clothes or a piece of plate
            made in the newest fashion? Men of reason, judge!</p>
