            <salute>My Dear Molly,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p><pb n="180"/>You have been much upon my thoughts this morning. Shall I tell you what I
            thought? Then take it<note place="foot" n="1">Orig., the word &apos;it&apos; is doubled
               at the end of one line and at the beginning of the next.</note> in good part. Take it
            kindly, as it is kindly meant.</p>
         <p>What do you gain by keeping my papers, or at least think you gain? Why, this: you gain
            the satisfaction of showing them, or parts of them, to others; you gain the power of
            justifying <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>, and of hurting (at least by vexing) <hi
               rend="italic">me</hi>; you gain occasion to make people think ill of <hi
               rend="italic">me</hi>, and to make them think well of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. And
            hereby you make yourself more friends and me more enemies.</p>
         <p>Very well. But are you quite sure of this? Is it <hi rend="italic">pure
               satisfaction</hi> which you gain by showing them? Is there not often a doubt whether
            you do right, a secret misgiving which spoils the satisfaction? Will the <hi
               rend="italic">showing</hi> them justify you for <hi rend="italic">taking</hi> them?
            Is it not rather adding sin to sin? And will not even men of the world say, &apos;What a
            wretch is this, first to <hi rend="italic">rob</hi>, then to <hi rend="italic"
               >expose</hi> her own husband&apos;? If, therefore, you make them think ill of me, you
            do not make them think well of <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>. If you make me more
            enemies, you do not make yourself one more friend. Nay, all these after a time are less
            your friends than ever they were before.</p>
         <p>But what if you did gain by it all that you suppose, would it make amends for what you
            lose thereby? You totally lose my esteem, you violently shock my love, you quite destroy
            my confidence. You oblige me to lock up everything as from a thief; to stand continually
            upon my guard, to watch all the time you are near me, as never knowing what you may
            steal next and expose to all the world. You cut yourself off from joint prayer. For how
            can I pray with one that is daily watching to do me hurt? You cut yourself off from all
            friendly intercourse with many who would otherwise rejoice to converse with and serve
            you. You rob yourself of many precious opportunities of public prayer and attending the
            Lordâ€™s Table.</p>
         <p>Now, how dearly must you love <hi rend="italic">justifying</hi> yourself and <hi
               rend="italic">blackening</hi> me, if you will do it at this expense?<pb n="181"/></p>
         <p>O <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>Molly</persName>, throw the fire out of
            your bosom! Shun as you would a serpent those that stir it up. And see in a true
            light,</p>
         <closer><signed>Your affectionate husband,<lb/><persName>John
            Wesley</persName></signed></closer>
