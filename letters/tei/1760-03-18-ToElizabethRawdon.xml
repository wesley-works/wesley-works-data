         <p>It was impossible to see the distress into which your Ladyship

            the steward of his family estate on <date when="1760-01-18">Jan. 18, 1760</date>. 
            The case was now heading towards trial in the House of Lords, at which 
            <persName><roleName type="nobility">Earl</roleName> Ferrers</persName> would be convicted, despite his plea of insanity. 
            He was executed on <date when="1760-05-05">May 5, 1760</date>.</note> 
            But may we not see God therein? May we not both hear and understand his voice?

            in the whirlwind. Permit me to speak to your Ladyship with all freedom, not as to a person of 
            quality, but as to a creature whom the Almighty made for himself and one that is in a few days 
            to appear before him</p>

            and such as were peculiarly qualified to rob you of your God. Two of these in particular were 
            sensible, learned, well-bred, well-natured, moral men. These did not assault you in a rough, 
            abrupt, offensive manner. No, you would then have armed yourself against them, and have repelled 
            all their attacks. But by soft, delicate, unobserved touches, by pleasing strokes of raillery, 
            by insinuations rather than surly arguments, they by little and little sapped the foundation of 
            your faith, perhaps not only of your <hi rend="italic">living</hi> faith, <index indexName="biblical">

            And oh what pleasure! What is the pleasure of visiting, of modern conversation? Is there any 
            more reason than religion in it? I wonder what rational appetite does it gratify? Setting religion
