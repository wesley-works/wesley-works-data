         <p>Poor <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>Molly</persName>! 
            Could you not hold out a little longer; not one
            month, not twenty days? Have you found out a pretence already
            for talking in the old strain? A thin one indeed. But, such as it is,
            it may serve the turn for want of a better. &apos;You have taken a bed to
            pieces. And you want to put it in my study. And I do not tell you
            whether you may or no&apos;! Truly I cannot look upon this whole affair
            as any other than a pretence. For what need had you to take the bed
            in pieces at all? And what need was there (if it was taken in pieces)
            that it should lie just in the one little room which I have, when you
            have four rooms to yourself ?</p>
         <p>Alas! That to this hour you should neither know your duty nor
            be willing to learn it! Indeed, if you were a wise [woman], whether
            a good woman or not, you would long since have given me a <hi rend="italic">carte
            blanche</hi>.<note where="foot" n="1">Orig. &apos;Chart Blanche&apos;; indicating full freedom or approval.</note> 
            You would have said, &apos;Tell me what to do, and I will do it.
            Tell me what to avoid, and I will avoid it. I promised to <hi rend="italic">obey</hi> you,
            and I will keep my word. Bid me do <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>, <hi rend="italic">everything</hi>. In whatever
            is not sinful, I <hi rend="italic">obey</hi>. You <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>, I will follow the direction.&apos;</p>
         <p>This it had been your wisdom to have done long ago, instead of
            squabbling for almost these ten years.<note where="foot" n="2">They were married in <date when="1751-02">February 1751</date>. 
            This comment implies that they had been at odds from the beginning in their marriage, though their 
            early correspondence does not reveal this.</note> This it is both your wisdom
            and your duty to do now, and certainly better late than never. This
            must be your indispensable duty, till 1) I am an adulterer, 2) you can
            prove it. Till then I have the same right to claim obedience from you
            as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have to claim it from <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2092.xml"/>Noah Vazeille</persName>.
            <note where="foot" n="3">Her son by her first marriage, now 13 years old.</note> Consequently every act
            of disobedience is an act of rebellion against God and the King, as
            well as against,</p>
