            <salute>Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p><pb n="174"/>Since I came to <placeName>Bristol</placeName> I heard many terrible
            accounts concerning the French prisoners at <placeName>Knowle</placeName>. As that
            &apos;they were so wedged together that they had no room to breathe, that the stench of
            the rooms where they lodged was intolerable, that their food was only fit for dogs, that
            their meat was carrion, their bread rotten and unwholesome, and that in consequence of
            this inhuman treatment, they died in whole shoals.&apos;<note place="foot" n="1">The
               prison at <placeName>Knowle</placeName>, now a <placeName>Bristol</placeName> suburb
               but then a distinct village, was utilised in the Seven Years War and
            beyond.</note></p>
         <p>Desiring to know the truth, I went to <placeName>Knowle</placeName> on <date
               when="1759-10-15">Monday</date>, and was showed all the apartments there.<note
               place="foot" n="2">See <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>,
                  <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1759-10-15">Oct. 15, 1759</date>;
               21:231 in this edn</note> But how was I disappointed! 1) I found they had large and
            convenient space to walk in, if they chose it, all the day. 2) There was no stench in
            any apartment which I was in, either below or above. They were all sweeter and cleaner
            than any prison I have seen either in <placeName>England</placeName> or elsewhere. 3)
            Being permitted to go into the larder, I observed the meat hanging up, two large
            quarters of beef. It was fresh and fat, and I verily think as good as I ever desire to
            eat. 4) A large quantity of bread lay on one side. A gentleman took up and cut one of
            the loaves. It was made of good flour, was well-baked, and perfectly well-tasted. 5)
            Going thence to the hospital, I found that even in this sickly season there are not
            thirty persons dangerously ill out of twelve or thirteen hundred. 6) The hospital was
            sweeter and cleaner throughout than any hospital I ever saw in
               <placeName>London</placeName>. I think it my duty to declare these things, for
            clearing the innocence and the honour of the English nation.<note place="foot" n="3"
               >When the <hi rend="italic">London Chronicle</hi> republished this letter, it
               explained, &apos;The following letter will give pleasure as the honour of the nation
               is vindicated by it&apos;.</note></p>
         <p>Yet one thing I observed with concern. A great part of these men are almost naked, and
            winter is now coming upon them in a cold prison and a colder climate than most of them
            have been accustomed to. But will not the humanity and generosity of the gentlemen of
               <placeName>Bristol</placeName> prevent or relieve this distress? Did they not make a
            notable precedent during the late war? And surely they are <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Gal6:9">not weary of well-doing</term>
            </index>.<note place="foot" n="4">See <index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Gal6:9">Gal. 6:9</term>

            <date when="1759-10-16">Tuesday</date> night we did a little according to our power, but
            I shall rejoice if this be forgotten through the abundance<pb n="175"/> administered by
            their liberality in a manner which they judge most proper. Will it not be both for the
            honour of their city and country, for the credit of our religion, and for the glory of
            God, who knows how to return it sevenfold into their bosom?</p>
