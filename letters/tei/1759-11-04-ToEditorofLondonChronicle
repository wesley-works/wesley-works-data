            <salute>Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p><pb n="178"/>An hour or two ago I was informed that a letter is inserted in your <date
               when="1759-11-03">yesterday</date>&apos;s paper,<note place="foot" n="1">This
               unsigned letter to the editor (<hi rend="italic">London Chronicle</hi>, <date
                  from="1759-11-01" to="1759-11-03">Nov. 1–3, 1759</date>, p. 431), while focused on
               appealing to upper class British for aid for the French prisoners, had described the
               apparent Methodist contribution as &apos;some little succour&apos; and suggested the
               amount given was unclear.</note> relating to one which I wrote at
               <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and which was since reprinted in
               <placeName>London</placeName> (p. 408).<note place="foot" n="2">I.e., <persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s letter to <hi
                  rend="italic"><persName><ref target="/persons/pers0694.xml"/>Felix
                     Farley</persName>&apos;s Bristol Journal</hi>, <date when="1759-10-20">Oct. 20,
                  1759</date>, which was reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">London
               Chronicle</hi>.</note> I therefore think it my duty, being thus publicly required, to
            give a farther account of the steps I have taken.</p>
         <p>On <date when="1759-10-16">Tuesday, October 16</date> last, I made a collection at the
            New Room in <placeName>Bristol</placeName> for the French prisoners confined at
               <placeName>Knowle</placeName>. The money contributed then, and the next day, was
            about three and twenty pounds. I judged it best to lay this out in shirts and
            waistcoats, and accordingly bought, of Mr. <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0758.xml"
               />Zephaniah Fry</persName>, in the <placeName>Castle</placeName>, check shirts and
            woollen cloth to the amount of eight pounds, ten shillings and sixpence, and of Mrs.
                  <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0464.xml"/>Sarah Coole</persName> in
               <placeName>Wine Street</placeName>, check linen to the amount of five pounds,
            seventeen shillings. The linen was immediately delivered out, partly to two or three
            poor women, who were to make them at the common price, partly to others, who were
            willing to make them for nothing; the woollen to <persName><ref
                  target="/persons/pers0985.xml"/>John Heath</persName> in <placeName>Castle
               Ditch</placeName>, who agreed to make the waistcoats at twenty-one pence each, and to
            whom (being poor) I advanced five shillings. The money remaining I lodged in the hands
            of Mr. <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1122.xml"/>James Ireland</persName> of
               <placeName>Horse Street</placeName>, as he speaks French readily, and Mr.
                  <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1806.xml"/>John Salter</persName>, of
               <placeName>Badminster</placeName>, who had been with me both at the prison and the
            hospital. I directed these 1) to give a waistcoat and two shirts to every one who was
            remanded from the hospital to the prison, and to keep about half the clothes which our
            money would procure, to be thus bestowed from time to time; 2) to dispose of the other
            half in the prison to those whom they should judge most needy and most deserving.</p>
