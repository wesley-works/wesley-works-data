            <salute>Dear Molly,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p><pb n="175"/>I will tell you simply and plainly the things which I dislike. If you
            remove them, well. If not, I am but where I was.</p>
         <p>I dislike 1) your showing any one my letters<note place="foot" n="1">The ms. has a
               series of comments in this paragraph that are not in <persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s hand (likely by
                     <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>Mary</persName>). Here is the
               first: &apos;Not being fit to be seen.&apos;</note> and private papers without my
            leave. This never did any good yet, either to you or me or any one. It only sharpens and
            embitters your own spirit. And the same effect it naturally has upon others. The same it
            would have upon me, but that (by the grace of God) I do not think of it.<note
               place="foot" n="2">The comment is added: &apos;NO.&apos;</note> It can do no good. It
            can never bring me nearer, though it may drive me farther off.<note place="foot" n="3"
               >The comment is added: &apos;Imposable.&apos;</note> And should you do as you often
            threaten, then the matter is over. &lt;I<note place="foot" n="4">A small repair covers
               where this word would surely appear.</note>&gt; know what I have to do.<note
               place="foot" n="5">The comment is added: &apos;Belye me as you have
               been?&apos;</note></p>
         <p>In all this you are fighting against yourself. You are frustrating your own purpose, if
            you want me to love you. You take just the wrong way. No one ever was <hi rend="italic"
               >forced</hi> to love another. It cannot be. Love can only be won by <hi rend="italic"
               >softness</hi>; foul means avail nothing. But you say, &apos;I have tried fair means,
            and they did not succeed.&apos; If they<pb n="176"/> do not, none will. Then you have
            only to say, &apos;<index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="2Kgs6:33">This evil is of the Lord.</term>
            </index><note place="foot" n="6">See <index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="2Kgs6:33">2 Kgs. 6:33</term>
               </index>.</note>
            <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Isa64:8">I am clay in his hand</term>
            </index>.&apos;<note place="foot" n="7">See <index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Isa64:8">Isa. 64:8</term>
               </index>.</note></p>
         <p>I dislike 2) not having the command of my own house, not being at liberty to invite even
            my nearest relations so much as to drink a dish of tea without disobliging <hi
               rend="italic">you</hi>.</p>
         <p>I dislike 3) the being myself a prisoner in my own house; the having my chamber door
            watched continually so that no person can go in or out but such as have your good
            leave.</p>
         <p>I dislike 4) the being but a prisoner at large, even when I go abroad, inasmuch as you
            are highly disgusted if I do not give you an account of every place I go to and every
            person with whom I converse.</p>
         <p>I dislike 5) the not being safe in my own house. My house is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
            my castle. I cannot call even my study, even my bureau, my own. They are liable to be
            plundered every day. You say, &apos;I plunder you of nothing but papers.&apos; I am not
            sure of that. How is it possible I should? I miss money too, and he that will steal a
            pin will steal a pound. But were it so, a scholar&apos;s papers are his treasureâ€”my
            journal in particular. &apos;But I took only such papers as relate to <persName><ref
                  target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>Sarah Ryan</persName> and <persName><ref
                  target="/persons/pers0506.xml"/>Sarah Crosby</persName>.&apos; That is not true.
            What are <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1248.xml"/>Mr. Landey</persName>&apos;s
            letters to them? Besides, you have taken parts of my journal which relate neither to one
            nor the other.</p>
         <p>I dislike 6) your treatment of my servants (though, indeed, they are not properly mine).
            You do all that in you lies to make their lives a burden to them. You browbeat, harass,
            rate them like dogs, make them afraid to speak to me. You treat them with such
            haughtiness, sternness, sourness, surliness, ill-nature, as never were known in any
            house of mine for near a dozen years. You forget even good breeding, and use such coarse
            language as befits none but a fishwife.<note place="foot" n="8">A woman that sells fish;
               connoting a vulgar woman.</note></p>
         <p>I dislike 7) your talking against me behind my back, and that every day and almost every
            hour of the day; making my faults (real or supposed) the standing topic of your
            conversation.</p>
         <p>I dislike 8) your slandering me, laying to my charge things which you know are false.
            Such are (to go but a few days back): that I beat you, which you told <persName><ref
                  target="/persons/pers0309.xml"/>James Burges</persName>;<note place="foot" n="9"
                     ><persName><ref target="/persons/pers0309.xml"/>Burges</persName> lived in
                  <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and had been an early supporter of the Kingswood
               School; see <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>, <hi
                  rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1757-10-25">Oct. 25, 1757</date>,
               21:129â€“30 in this edn.</note> that I rode to <placeName>Kingswood</placeName> with
                  <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>Sarah Ryan</persName>, which you
            told <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1728.xml"/>Sarah Rigby</persName>; and that I
            required you, when we were first married, never to sit in my presence without my leave,
            which you told <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1265.xml"/>Mrs. Lee</persName>,
                  <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0759.xml"/>Mrs. Fry</persName>, and several
            others, and stood to it before my face.<pb n="177"/></p>
         <p>I dislike 9) your common custom of saying things not true. To instance only in two or
            three particulars. You told <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1122.xml"/>Mr.
               Ireland</persName>,<note place="foot" n="10"><persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers1122.xml"/>James Ireland</persName> of
                  <placeName>Bristol</placeName> (see the letter of <date when="1759-11-04">Nov. 4,
                  1759</date>).</note> &apos;Mr. <persName>Vazeille</persName> learnt Spanish in a
            fortnight.&apos; You told <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0758.xml"/>Mr.
               Fry</persName>, &apos;<persName><ref target="/persons/pers2194.xml"/>Mrs.
               Ellison</persName><note place="foot" n="11">I.e., <persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2194.xml"/>Susanna (Wesley) Ellison</persName>,
                     <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s sister. At
               this point <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2194.xml"/>Susanna</persName> (or
               &apos;Suky&apos;) was living in <placeName>London</placeName>.</note> was the author
            as to my intrigue in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>.&apos; You told Mrs. <persName><ref
                  target="/persons/pers2194.xml"/>Ellison</persName> &apos;you never said any such
            thing; you never charged her with it.&apos; You also told her &apos;that I had laid a
            plot to serve you as Susannah was served by the two elders.&apos;<note place="foot"
               n="12">Referring to the story in the apocryphal book of Susanna, included by the
               Catholic Church in the book of Daniel.</note></p>
         <p>I dislike 10) Your extreme, immeasurable bitterness to all who endeavour to defend my
            character (as my brother, <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1180.xml"/>Joseph
               Jones</persName>, <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0355.xml"/>Clayton
               Carthy</persName>), breaking out even into foul, unmannerly language, such as ought
            not to defile a gentlewoman&apos;s lips if she did not believe one word of the
            Bible.</p>
         <p>And now, <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>Molly</persName>, what would any
            one advise you to that has a real concern for your happiness? Certainly 1) to show,
            read, touch those letters no more, if you did not restore them to their proper owner; 2)
            to allow me the command of my own house, with free leave to invite thither whom I
            please; 3) to allow me my liberty there that any who will may come to me without let or
            hindrance; 4) to let me go where I please and to whom I please without giving an account
            to any; 5) to assure me you will take no more of my papers nor anything of mine without
            my consent; 6) to treat all the servants where you are, whether you like them or no,
            with courtesy and humanity, and to speak (if you speak at all) to them, as well as
            others, with good nature and good manners; 7) to speak no evil of me behind my back; 8)
            never to accuse me falsely; 9) to be extremely cautious of saying anything that is not
            strictly true, both as to the matter and manner; and 10) to avoid all bitterness of
            expression till you can avoid all bitterness of spirit.</p>
         <p>These are the advices which I now give you in the fear of God and in tender love to your
            soul. Nor can I give you a stronger proof that I am,</p>
         <closer><signed>Your affectionate husband,<lb/><persName>John
